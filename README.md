# Project Wycheproof

*Project Wycheproof is named after
[Mount Wycheproof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wycheproof), the smallest
mountain in the world. The main motivation for the project is to have a goal
that is achievable. The smaller the mountain the more likely it is to be able to
climb it.*

## Introduction

Project Wycheproof tests crypto libraries against known attacks.

Unfortunately, in cryptography, subtle mistakes can have catastrophic
consequences, and we found that libraries fall into such implementation
pitfalls much too often and for much too long. Good implementation guidelines,
however, are hard to come by: understanding how to implement cryptography
securely requires digesting decades' worth of academic literature. We recognize
that software engineers fix and prevent bugs with unit testing, and we found
that cryptographic loopholes can be resolved by the same means.

These observations have prompted us to develop Project Wycheproof, a collection
of unit tests that detect known weaknesses or check for expected behaviors of
some cryptographic algorithm. Project Wycheproof provides tests for most
cryptographic algorithms, including RSA, elliptic curve crypto and
authenticated encryption. Our cryptographers have systematically surveyed the
literature and implemented most known attacks. We have over 80 test cases which
have uncovered more than [40 bugs](doc/bugs.md). For
example, we found that we could recover the private key of widely-used DSA and
ECDHC implementations.

While we are committed to develop as many attacks as possible, Project
Wycheproof is by no means complete. Passing the tests does not imply that the
library is secure, it just means that it is not vulnerable to the attacks that
Project Wycheproof tests for. Cryptographers are also constantly discovering
new attacks. Nevertheless, with Project Wycheproof developers and users now can
check their libraries against a large number of known attacks, without having
to spend years reading academic papers or become cryptographers themselves.

### Coverage

Project Wycheproof has tests for the most popular crypto algorithms, including

- AES-EAX
- AES-GCM
- ChaCha20-Poly1305
- [DH](doc/dh.md)
- DHIES
- [DSA](doc/dsa.md)
- [ECDH](doc/ecdh.md)
- ECDSA
- EdDSA
- ECIES
- HKDF
- HMAC
- [RSA](doc/rsa.md)
- X25519, X448

The tests detect whether a library is vulnerable to many attacks, including

*   Invalid curve attacks
*   Biased nonces in digital signature schemes
*   Of course, all Bleichenbacherâ€™s attacks
*   And many more -- we have over 80 test cases

### Hall of Bugs

Here are some of the notable vulnerabilities that are uncovered by
Project Wycheproof:

*   OpenJDK's SHA1withDSA leaks private keys > 1024 bits
    *   Test: testBiasSha1WithDSA in [DsaTest][dsa-test].
    *   This bug is the same as [CVE-2003-0971][cve-2003-0971] ("GnuPG generated
        ElGamal signatures that leaked the private key").

*   Bouncy Castle's ECDHC leaks private keys
    *   Test: testModifiedPublic and testWrongOrderEcdhc in
        [EcdhTest][ecdh-test].
