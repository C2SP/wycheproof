RFC 3279 allows to encode such curves by explicitly encoding, the parameters of the curve equation, modulus, generator, order and cofactor. However, many crypto libraries only support named curves.

      "effect": "Computing an ECDH key exchange with public and private keys can in the worst case lead to an invalid curve attack. Hence, it is important that ECDH implementations check the input parameters. The severity of such bugs is typically smaller if an implementation ensures that the point is on the curve and that the ECDH computation is performed on the curve of the private key. Some of the test vectors with modified public key contain shared ECDH secrets, that were computed over the curve of the private key."
