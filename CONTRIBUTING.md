Want to contribute? Great!

### Before you contribute
Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

### Disclosure
If your tests uncover security vulnerabilities, please first report directly to
the maintainers of the libraries. You should only submit tests to us once the
bugs have been acknowledged or fixed.

### Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.
