# Diffie-Hellman

## Subgroup confinement attacks

The papers by van Oorshot and Wiener [[OorWie96]](bib.md#oorwie96) rsp. Lim and
Lee [[LimLee98]](bib.md#limlee98) show that Diffie-Hellman keys can be found
much faster if the short exponents are used and if the multiplicative group
modulo p contains small subgroups. In particular an attacker can try to send a
public key that is an element of a small subgroup. If the receiver does not
check for such elements then may be possible to find the private key modulo the
order of the small subgroup. Several countermeasures against such attacks have
been proposed: For example IKE uses fields of order p where p is a safe prime
(i.e. $$q=(p-1)/2),$$ hence the only elements of small order are 1 and p-1.

[[NIST-SP800-56A]](bib.md#nist-sp800-56a) rev. 2, Section 5.5.1.1 only requires
that the size of the subgroup generated by the generator g is big enough to
prevent the baby-step giant-step algorithm. I.e. for 80-bit security p must be
at least 1024 bits long and the prime q must be at least 160 bits long. A 2048
bit prime p and a 224 bit prime q are sufficient for 112 bit security. To avoid
subgroup confinment attacks NIST requires that public keys are validated, i.e.
by checking that a public key y satisfies the conditions $$2 \leq y \leq p-2$$
and $$y^q \mod p = 1$$ (Section 5.6.2.3.1). Further, after generating the shared
secret $$z = y_a^{x_b} \mod p$$ each party should check that $$z \neq 1.$$ RFC
2785 contains similar recommendations. The public key validation described by
NIST requires that the order q of the generator g is known to the verifier.
Unfortunately, the order q is missing in [[PKCS #3]](bib.md#pkcs-3).
[[PKCS #3]](bib.md#pkcs-3) describes the Diffie-Hellman parameters only by the
values p, g and optionally the key size in bits.

The class DHParameterSpec that defines the Diffie-Hellman parameters in JCE
contains the same values as [[PKCS #3]](bib.md#pkcs-3). In particular, it does
not contain the order of the subgroup q. Moreover, the SUN provider uses the
minimal sizes specified by NIST for q. Essentially the provider reuses the
parameters for DSA.

Therefore, there is no guarantee that an implementation of Diffie-Hellman is
secure against subgroup confinement attacks. Without a key validation it is
insecure to use the key-pair generation from
[[NIST-SP800-56A]](bib.md#nist-sp800-56a) Section 5.6.1.1 (The key-pair
generation there only requires that static and ephemeral private keys are
randomly chosen in the range $$1..q-1)$$.

To avoid big disasters the tests below require that key sizes are not minimal.
I.e., currently the tests require at least 512 bit keys for 1024 bit fields. We
use this lower limit because that is what the SUN provider is currently doing.

TODO(bleichen): Find a reference supporting or disproving that decision.

## Weak parameters

The DH parameters must be carefully chosen to avoid security issues. A panel at
Eurocrypt'92 discussed the possiblity of trapdoors in DL based primitives
[[Eurocrypt92-panel]](bib.md#eurocrypt92-panel). A. Lenstra pointed out that the
primes chould be chosen such that the special number field sieve can be used to
compute discrete logarithms. Gordon has analyzed methods to generate and detect
weak parameters [[Gordon92]](bib.md#gordon92). Section 4 of Gordons paper
describes a method that can detect some special cases, but no general method was
given. Recently Fried et al. showed that 1024 bit discrete logarithms with the
special number field sieve are feasible [[FGHT16]](bib.md#fght16). Moreover some
libraries use primes that are susceptible to this attack
[[FGHT16]](bib.md#fght16).

TODO(bleichen): So far no test for weak DH parameters has been implemented.
Possibly we should at least implement a test that detects special cases, so that
weak primes (such as the one used in libtomcrypt) are detected.

DH implementations are sometimes misconfigured. Adrian et al. The authors of
[[WeakDh]](bib.md#weakdh) analyzed various implementations and found for example
the following problems in the parameters: p is sometimes composite, p-1 contains
no large prime factor, q is used instead of the generator g.
